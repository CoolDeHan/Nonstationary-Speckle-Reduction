Thanks very much for your attention to our work!

In the experiments for the real SAR images, because one of the reference algorithm (i.e. Naka-FoE) is the most time consuming, we suggest that the readers run the code called  'QuickView_Filtering_Real_SAR_Images' to get an overview of despeckling results.

For example, for images of size 512*512 in single look processed in our experiments, a typical run time of the Naka-FoE is about 762.47s (12.7 minutes).
